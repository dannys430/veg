The Pita Jungle idea was born: it took off like a brush fire with locations scorching the Arizona landscape and more recently spreading to California's. Pita Jungle espouses the Mediterranean diet principles by providing through its new American cuisine menu a fine balance of low fat meats, seafood, vegetables, legumes, grains, nuts, olive oil and fruits. It remains ever faithful to its slogan, The Art of Eating Healthy. Pita Jungle is artsy and subtlety hip. Every location looks different in design and is adorned by local art/paintings on rotation. The music extending from fusion Jazz to Indy rock, classical to Cuban, engenders an upbeat mood, where expeditious service covers tables with myriads of Tapas, taboule, hummus, baba ganoosh, paired with boutique wines, local beers and spirits, Happy Hour and Reverse Happy Hour. Pita Jungle's commitment to responsible and healthy living goes beyond the food they serve on their table. Pita Jungle is actively involved in projects that favor our environment, from sponsorship of research and development projects pertaining to the resolution of macro environmental problems, down to the store level, where they phased out styro-foam containers, along with their participation in the save a straw program that seeks to reduce the disposal of a hard to recycle item. Also and perhaps more significantly, through the purchase of carbon credits, Pita Jungle offsets all of their operation related carbon emissions: Pita Jungle is carbon neutral.",,"[{""key"":""Other Information:"",""value"":""Parking: Garage, Street, On SiteWi-Fi: NoBike Parking: YesAttire: CasualWheelchair Accessible: NoCuisines: Mediterranean, Greek, EuropeanAlcohol: Beer, Full Bar, WineTakes Reservations: NoOutdoor Seating: YesPrice Range : Average""}]","[{""day"":""Mon - Thu"",""hour"":""11:00 am - 10:00 pm""},{""day"":""Fri - Sat"",""hour"":""11:00 am - 11:00 am""},{""day"":""Sun"",""hour"":""11:00 am - 9:00 pm""}]",,,us/ca/pasadena/43ecoloradoblvd/-347470378,34.14578,,-118.14954,,,Pita Jungle (pasadena),"amex, discover, master card, visa",6264327482,91105,,CA,,,http://www.pitajungle.com/catering,POINT(-118.14954 34.14578)

Despite increased frozen-dessert competition, Baskin Robbins, always easy to find on Voice Places, has been named the top ice cream franchise in the United States by Entrepreneur magazine. Its nearly 7,000 retail shops have revolutionized the way we buy ice cream, with an ever-changing menu launched in 1945 in Glendale, California. Specialty flavors by the gallon or the scoop come and go, but the most popular ones-Mint Chocolate Chip; Butter Pecan; Rocky Road-have become perennials. Seasonal flavors and grab-and-go treats are a staple, and recent additions to Baskin Robbins' innovative dessert menu include hand-packed ice cream quarts, a unique flavor ribbon technique, and the introduction of mousse-textured ice creams. Signature ice cream cakes and a growing line of ice-creamy beverages (including the coffee-centric Cappuccino Blast) continue a tradition of mixing up the cold-dessert world.",,,,,FALSE,us/il/chicago/4867milwaukeeave/89177860,,,,"[{""categories"":""restaurant"",""descriptions"":""our freshly baked bagel, twisted with savory or sweet flavors for whenever you are on the go."",""name"":""Bagel Twist""},{""categories"":""restaurant"",""descriptions"":""we've raised the bar on the basic grilled cheese you ate as a kid. melted american and white cheddar cheese between two pieces of thick texas toast. yes, it's as good as it sounds."",""name"":""Texas Toast Grilled Cheese""},{""categories"":""restaurant"",""descriptions"":""our tasty tuna salad sandwich is blended with mayonnaise, celery, herbs and spices all on a toasted plain bagel. or, try our oven-toasted tuna melt, featuring the same tasty ingredients and topped with a slice of cheddar cheese on a croissant. both will hit the spot and keep you runnin'."",""name"":""Tuna Salad Sandwiches""},{""categories"":""restaurant"",""descriptions"":""with angus steak on a freshly baked onion bagel, you'll feel like the boss, alright. but why just feel like one?
